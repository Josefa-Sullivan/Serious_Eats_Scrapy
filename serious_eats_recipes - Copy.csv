45 minutes,Daniel Gritzer,Roasting," Combine soy sauce, lime juice, oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) marinade to a separate vessel and set aside., Place steaks in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in marinade. Lay flat in refrigerator, turning every couple of hours, for at least 3 and up to 10 hours., When ready to cook, preheat broiler and position over rack to highest position. If you have a baking steel or stone, set it 
on the top rack and allow to preheat. If using a baking steel/stone, set a rimmed baking sheet on it to preheat as well; otherwise leave the baking sheet at room temperature.,Remove steaks from marinade and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange steaks in an even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Broil, without flipping, until steaks are well charred on top side, about 4 minutes. Broiler strength and oven designs vary greatly, so cooking times will vary as well; keep a close watch. If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning. If not using a baking steel or stone, flip steaks and broil for 30 seconds longer (steaks cooked with the help of a baking steel/stone do not need to be flipped and cooked longer). Remove from oven and transfer steaks to a platter to rest.,Switch oven from broil mode to 450°F (230°C). Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers as well as onions to baking sheet. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of marinade all over and toss until evenly coated; using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits on the baking sheet. Arrange peppers and onion in an even layer that covers the baking sheet from edge to edge, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 25 minutes (if your oven heats from the top, you will want to cook the vegetables on a middle rack to avoid excessive scorching and burning). If you're using a baking steel/stone, you can cook the vegetables on it, but keep a closer eye since they run the risk of scorching on the bottom; if this begins to happen, move the sheet pan to another rack.,Slice steak into thin strips across the grain; then add back to sheet pan with any juices.

When dairy comes to a simmer, remove from heat, cover and let cool to room temperature, about 4 hours. Proceed to next step, or refrigerate up to 24 hours to extract stronger banana flavor. The exact timing will depend on both personal preference and convenience. 
, Return banana milk to simmer over medium heat, stirring as before; then strain through , into medium bowl. Press gently on banana pulp to release liquid, but don't allow pulp to pass through sieve. Pulp can be refrigerated to use in muffins, pancakes, or smoothies, but it will not benefit the custard. If using vanilla pod, scrape out flavorful milk inside each half with flexible spatula before discarding. ,Using the same 3-quart saucier as before (no need to wash), whisk sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cloves together until well combined, followed by egg yolks. Whisk in infused milk.

When it begins to bubble, set timer and continue whisking for 90 seconds. This step is important to neutralize starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks. Off-heat, stir in vanilla extract and season to taste with additional vanilla, salt, or cloves. If desired, strain custard through same sieve as before (again, no need to wash) to remove bits of chalazae that may remain or any accidentally curdled custard.

Alternatively, the prepared custard can be refrigerated up to one week., In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip cream to stiff peaks. Meanwhile, use flexible spatula to stir chilled custard until smooth and soft (this can be done right in the baking dish or in a separate bowl if you prefer). Add about 1/3 of the cream to banana custard; then fold and stir until smooth before folding in remaining whipped cream. Transfer to , fitted with a , and divide between serving dishes.
